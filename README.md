Script for getting a ubuntu box into dev mode

## Simple Bootstrap

A recent build of Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS gave rise to the need for a few tools etc.

By no means exhastive and has a .NET flavour to it, run as root, have a coffee:

    sudo ./bootstrap.sh

For the brave:

    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulkohler/ubuntu-linux-bootstrap/master/bootstrap.sh | sudo -E bash -

## Main Packages

* Chrome
* .NET for linux (dotnet-sdk-2.0.0)
* Visual Studio Code
* Node/npm/yarn

Reminders about git setup etc
